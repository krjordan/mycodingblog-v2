<h2>> Hey there<span class="logo__cursor" style="width: 3px; height: 1.625rem;"></span></h2>

My name is Ryan Jordan and I'm a full-time web developer living in Huntsville, AL. I started in web development a couple of years ago and have a bachelor's degree from Athens State University in Computer Science with a minor in Information Systems Management.

Web development has given me the opportunity to solve real problems and meet a lot of interesting people. I find it an exciting field because it is challenging and keeps me on my toes, since it's constantly changing. When I'm not coding, I can be found playing PC/PS4 Games or training my Belgian Malinois for Search & Rescue.

If you have a project that you need help with, I'd love to help out! You can message me on [Twitter](//twitter.com/ryanjordandev) or shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:ryjordan@gmail.com">RyJordan@Gmail.com</a>. You can also check out some of the products I've been working on by visiting my [portfolio](//ryanjordan.me).
